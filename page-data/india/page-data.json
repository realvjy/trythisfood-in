In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"./salty_egg.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"India","date":"October 01, 2019","description":"India"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/india/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/japan/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Japan"}}}}}
